TemperatureMeasurement
======================

Thermocouple measurement and logger (tested with Raspberry Pi)

This code implements a web server in Node.js which is
used to construct a simple temperature logging platform called TLP-1
In addition the file 'therm.c' is used to construct an interface to the Texas Instruments
430BOOST-ADS1118 product.
